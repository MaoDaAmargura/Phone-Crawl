Player uses item from inventory outside of combat
-------------------------------------------------
- Character has a 2/5 real hit points (HP) and 0/5 fake hit points (FHP)
- Character has health potion in his inventory called Full Heal that will heal him to 5/5 HP and 5/5 FHP


Player has just finished a battle in one of the game areas, and is low on hit points. Not wanting to risk being found by another monster while low on health in order to avoid having to waste a turn during combat itself, or risk having the monster attack first and kill him, Player taps the Inventory tab, and taps on a health potion. A confirmation box pops up to confirm that Player did, in fact, intend to use the item that was selected. If Player selected the wrong item, Player can tap "No" and either select again or leave the inventory screen.

Player selects "Yes". Game system calls the method for the spell that goes with the potion, and Player's health is increased immediately. Inventory screen goes away, and Player is returned to main world view.

- Inventory Screen has a list of bag slots (where items not used or equipped are shown), and a list of equipment slots (where equipped armor and/or weapons are shown).


Player taps the Inventory button. Player touches the Icy Helmet of Ice and drags it to the Helmet slot on his character diagram. The Fiery Helmet of Fire is replaced by the Icy Helmet of Ice, and the Fiery Helmet of Fire is returned automatically to the first empty slot in the inventory. Inventory window stays open.

The spell "Lesser Fireball" is added to the character's list of spells.
