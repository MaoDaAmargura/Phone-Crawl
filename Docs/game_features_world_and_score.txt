        a) World

The world of Phone Crawl is a large and very random subterrane, full of magic and frequent violence.  From the starting town, there are five areas accessable.

-The Orc Mines, where beastly creatures endlessly tunnel and toil.
-The Underground Forest, where tremendous trees and fungi grow, and nameless things lurk amongst their roots.
-The Morlock Tunnels, where the worst criminals are sent to go mad and twisted in the dark.
-The Crypt, where the dead rise and walk, cannibalizing their own dry bones to build ever more powerful monstrosities deep beneath the surface.
-The Abyss, where demons and abominations endlessly torture their mortal prisoners, and the ground itself twists and reshapes to entrap the unfortunate traveler.

Note that once you depart from one of the five areas, it will never be the same again.  Make sure not to leave anything valuable!

		(b)Score

Upon being defeated by your enemies, you will be given the option to retire your character, or cheat death for a chance at revenge!  Retiring deletes your save file, placing you immediately into the halls of Valhalla, where brave warriors are ranked according to their high scores.  Cheating death places you safely back in town instead, but drastically decreases your score.

Almost anything you do during the lifetime of your character increases your score, from slaying monsters, to accumulating gold and valuable equipment.  Don't lose heart if you find yourself with a very low (or even negative) score after cheating death, as points accumulate much more quickly for powerful characters.

Rumor has it that somewhere, in the deepest and most dangerous corner of the dungeons beneath the earth, there may be found a way to ascend to Valhalla without dying to do it...
