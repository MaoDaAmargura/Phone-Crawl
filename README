Okay, so here goes:

I've set up a partition-like file structure. If you're making a class that involves something drawn to the screen, it goes in UI/. If they won't see it, it probably goes in Data/. We can make more partitions later if needed. I think Nathan and I will mostly be handling UI, but we should have a job meeting at some point. 

I'm going to do the HomeTabViewController, to keep the structure simple.
